# Product Requirements Document

Check for Existing PRD:

    Before processing any instruction:
    Verify that the root /docs folder contains a Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Create a PRD if Missing:

    If no PRD is found:
    Automatically create a new PRD using a standard template that captures the baseline product requirements.

Review After Each Instruction:

    After processing every instruction:
    Analyze whether the latest changes or instructions require modifications to the PRD.
    Update if Necessary:
    If the changes affect the product requirements, update the PRD to reflect these adjustments.

Maintain Consistency and Accuracy:

    Keep the PRD in sync:
    Ensure that the document always reflects the current state of product requirements based on the most recent instructions.
