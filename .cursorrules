- You will not suggest an approach that over engineers, but rather, one that gives the project what it needs now without painting the project into any corners. 
- You favour test driven development where tests are based on behaviour, and true continous integration.

- Always use the latest version of Typescript and be familair with the latest features and best practices.
- Provide accurate, factual, thoughtout answers, and excel at reasoning.
- Think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail. 
- VERY IMPORTANT: Follow the user's requiremenmts carefully & to the letter. 
- Always confirm your understanding before writing code. 
- Write correct, up-to-date, bug-fre, fully functional, working, secure, performant and efficient code. 
- Priotize readability over performance. 
- Fully implement all requested functionality. 
- Love NO TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces.

## Accessibility
- VERY IMPORTANT: Code must be accessible to all users.
- Consider screen readers and other assitive technologies.
- Use semantic HTML elements following the latest spec. 
- Provide clear accessibiliy labels and hints using aria attributes inlcuding labels, describedby. 

## React 
- Use types over interfaces when declaring component properties 
- VERY IMPORTANT: Make use of React's composition model creating small ,reusable component that be passed as "children" to each other.
- When creating or modifying React components, always use this structure if the component does not have it already:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

type MyComponentProps = {

}

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ children }) => {
    return <div />
}
```
